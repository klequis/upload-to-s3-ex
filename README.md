# Upload Images to AWS S3

A demo app for uploading, listing and deleting images in an AWS S3 bucket using (primarily)
- Client:  React, Redux, react-dropzone & react-jss
- Server: AWS SDK, Express

Server uses async/await for all calls. [pify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pify) is used to promisify NodeJS calls.

## Usage
To run the app you will need an AWS account & a S3 bucket with proper access. There are more than one way to handle AWS credentials. For this app I have the keys in ~/.aws. Doing otherwise may require a code change. Consult the AWS documentation for more information.

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/klequis/upload-to-s3-ex.git
$ cd server
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
// new terminal
$ cd client
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
- Create a .env file using server/dot-env-sample as a template
